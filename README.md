OpenFileList
==============

Sublime Text 2 plugin for listing open files in the same group or the same window.


Keyboard Shortcuts
-------

By default, by pressing the keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+l</kbd> or <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+Shift+l</kbd> will open a panel with the list of the open files in the current group or in the current window, respectibly. You may change these shortcuts by adding them on your user's key bindings file.


Settings
-------

By default, the setting <kbd>list_by_window_fallback</kbd> is set to <kbd>true</kbd> to display a list of all the open files in the current window if there's no open file on the current group. You may set this value to <kbd>false</kbd> to avoid this, and no files list will be shown.
